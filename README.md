Medical No-show data analysis, basic visualisations, and summative statistics

The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of appoinment records for Brasil public hospitals. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to appointments. The analysis should be focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments. Using descriptive statistics the following question should be answered: What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? Predictive analytics is out of scope of this project.
